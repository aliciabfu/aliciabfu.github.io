    I had the pleasure of working with Alicia during our time at Major Tom, where she led the paid search practice with deep expertise and unwavering dedication.

    Her ability to translate complex data into actionable strategy is unmatched, whether optimizing performance, navigating platform changes, or identifying growth opportunities.

    What really stood out to me was her calm, thoughtful approach to leadership. She always made time to mentor others and share her knowledge generously.

    Any team would be lucky to have someone with her strategic mindset, collaborative spirit, and command of the ever-evolving paid media landscape.
